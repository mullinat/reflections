Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Automatically pulling code can break your code it you are on a different commit
	What would happen if you were on a different branch?
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks append and can be managed by groups of people
	Clones copy what is in an existing repository
	Branches are different versions of code that still exists in a repository
Commands Used:
Use git remote to see all remotes
git remote add origin
        note that origin can be whatever name I want because I can have multiple remotes
git remote add origin https://github.com/mullinat/reflections.git
        add location to origin
git remote -v
git push origin master
git pull origin master
