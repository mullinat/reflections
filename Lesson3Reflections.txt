Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Automatically pulling code can break your code it you are on a different commit
	What would happen if you were on a different branch?

Commands Used:
Use git remote to see all remotes
git remote add origin
        note that origin can be whatever name I want because I can have multiple remotes
git remote add origin https://github.com/mullinat/reflections.git
        add location to origin
git remote -v
git push origin master
git pull origin master
